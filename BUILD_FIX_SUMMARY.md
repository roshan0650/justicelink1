# ✅ BUILD FIX COMPLETE - READY TO REDEPLOY

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

I've identified and fixed all the build issues that were preventing Netlify deployment:

### **Issue 1: Next.js Version Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Next.js 14.0.0 had compatibility issues
- **Fix**: Updated to Next.js 14.2.3 (latest stable)
- **File**: `frontend/package.json`

### **Issue 2: Missing Static Export Configuration**
- **Problem**: Next.js wasn't configured for static export
- **Fix**: Added `output: 'export'` to next.config.js
- **File**: `frontend/next.config.js`

### **Issue 3: Image Optimization Issues**
- **Problem**: Image optimization not compatible with static export
- **Fix**: Added `unoptimized: true` to images config
- **File**: `frontend/next.config.js`

### **Issue 4: Wrong Publish Directory**
- **Problem**: Netlify was looking for `.next` directory (doesn't exist with static export)
- **Fix**: Changed publish directory to `out` (where static export generates files)
- **File**: `frontend/netlify.toml`
