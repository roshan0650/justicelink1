2. Find your site
3. Click: "Trigger deploy" or "Redeploy site"
4. Wait 3-5 minutes
5. Check build logs
6. ✅ Site should be LIVE!

---

### Option 2: Deploy Fresh (If Not Deployed Yet)

If you haven't deployed to Netlify yet:

1. Go to: https://netlify.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click: "Add new site"
4. Choose: "Import an existing project"
5. Select: "GitHub"
6. Find: `roshan0650/justicelink1`
7. Click on it
8. Configure:
   - **Base directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `out`
9. Click: "Deploy site"
10. Wait 3-5 minutes

## ✅ VERIFICATION

## 📊 BUILD CONFIGURATION

**Netlify Settings:**

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `out`

## 🎯 YOUR FRONTEND URL

After deployment:
```
https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

**Save this URL!** You'll need it for STEP 3.

## 🆘 IF BUILD STILL FAILS

1. Check Netlify build logs for specific errors
2. Common solutions:
   - Clear Netlify cache: Site settings → Build & deploy → Clear cache
   - Redeploy: Trigger deploy again
   - Check Node version: Should be 18.17.0
