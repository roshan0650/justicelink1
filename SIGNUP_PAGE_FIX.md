# ✅ SIGNUP PAGE FIX - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Issue Fixed

The signup page was showing "Failed to fetch" error because the frontend was pointing to the **production backend URL** instead of the **local development backend**.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**File**: `frontend/.env.local`

**Problem**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://justicelink-backend.onrender.com
```

The frontend was trying to connect to the production Render backend, which:
1. Doesn't have the same data as local development
2. May not be running
3. Causes CORS issues in local development

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Changed**: `frontend/.env.local`

**From**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://justicelink-backend.onrender.com
```

**To**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🔧 What Happened

1. ✅ Updated `frontend/.env.local` to point to localhost
2. ✅ Next.js automatically detected the environment change
3. ✅ Frontend reloaded with new API URL
4. ✅ Backend is running on port 5000
5. ✅ API endpoints now respond correctly

---

## 🧪 Verification

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```
**Response**: ✅ 200 OK

### API Test - User Registration
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Body: {
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "userType": "user"
}
```
**Response**: ✅ 200 OK - User created with JWT token

## 📝 Important Notes

### For Local Development

- Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3001`

### For Production
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to production backend URL
- Deploy to Netlify/Vercel
- Backend should be deployed to Render

---

## 🔐 Security

- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (not committed)
- Production API key is safe
- Local development uses localhost
- No secrets exposed

---

## ✨ All Features Working

✅ User Registration
✅ User Login
✅ JWT Authentication
