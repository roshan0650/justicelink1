### STEP 1.5: Configure Build Settings

This is the MOST IMPORTANT part! Fill in these fields:

- **Clear** any existing text
- **Type**: `frontend`
- This tells Netlify where your frontend code is

**Field 2: Build command**

- **Clear** any existing text
- **Type**: `npm run build`
- This tells Netlify how to build your site

**Field 3: Publish directory**
- **Click** the input field
- **Clear** any existing text
- **Type**: `.next`
- This tells Netlify which folder to publish

**Environment variables** (optional for now):
- Leave empty for now
- We'll add them later if needed

---

### STEP 1.6: Deploy Your Site

1. **Review** your settings:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
2. **Click**: "Deploy site" button
3. Netlify will start building your site
4. You'll see a progress bar and build logs

---

### STEP 1.7: Wait for Deployment

The build process takes 3-5 minutes:

1. You'll see logs showing:
   - "Installing dependencies..."
   - "Building site..."
   - "Optimizing..."
2. When complete, you'll see:
   - "Site is live"
   - A URL like: `https://xxx-yyy-123.netlify.app`

---

### STEP 1.8: Get Your Frontend URL

1. **Look for** the site name/URL at the top of the page
2. It will look like: `https://justicelink-frontend-123.netlify.app`
3. **Click on it** to visit your live site
4. You should see the JusticeLink landing page!
5. **Copy and save this URL** - you'll need it for STEP 3!

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Build failed"

**Solution**:
1. Click on the failed deploy
2. Look at the build logs
3. Common issues:
   - Wrong base directory (should be `frontend`)
   - Wrong build command (should be `npm run build`)
   - Wrong publish directory (should be `.next`)
4. Fix the settings and redeploy

### Problem: "Site shows 404 error"

**Solution**:
1. Check publish directory is `.next`
2. Try hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
3. Wait 5 minutes and try again
4. Redeploy the site

### Problem: "Can't find my repository"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're signed in with GitHub
2. Make sure code is pushed to GitHub
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting GitHub
4. Check repository is public

### Problem: "Site shows blank page"

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Try hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Check build logs for errors

## üìù Important Notes

- **Free tier**: Netlify free tier is perfect for development
- **Auto-deploy**: Every time you push to GitHub, Netlify auto-deploys
- **Build time**: First build takes 3-5 minutes, subsequent builds are faster
- **URL**: Your URL will be something like `xxx-yyy-123.netlify.app`
