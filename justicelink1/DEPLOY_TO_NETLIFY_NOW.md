## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Drag and drop not working"
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Make sure you're dragging the `public` folder
- Try uploading as a ZIP file instead

### "404 Error after deployment"
- Make sure `public/index.html` exists
- Check Netlify build logs
- Verify publish directory is set to `public`

### "Site not loading"
- Wait 30 seconds for Netlify to process
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
